# PORFOLIO - 2021
Here you have my first beautyfly made Porfolio, with all it's errors and whatever... I'm really proud of it even though it's (clearly) not perfect, but I did learnt a lot, and I'm still learning! So, I promise I'll do a better one next time!

I did it as a final project for a [DOMESTIKA](https://www.domestika.org/) course, taught by Javier Usobiaga Ferrer:
[Diseño, desarrollo y publicación de una página web.](https://www.domestika.org/es/courses/1042-diseno-desarrollo-y-publicacion-de-una-pagina-web)

We used [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) to do it, and I must admit I was kind of lost with all the folders and stuff, I think that if I have to use it again (I really hope not), I would not remember a thing about how it works.

> THERE **WILL** BE A 2020 PORFOLIO (As I'm currently enrolled in a Full
> Stack Web Master's degree).
